### My First ever Github repo, now archived.

## What?
Originally this was a simple test application for PhoneGap (Now known as Apache Cordova.) It tested the possibility of converting Scratch Projects (sb2/sb3) files into full blown APK apps.
I don't remember what converter I used at the moment but if you're looking for a Scratch Project to HTML Converter, use
[The TurboWarp Packager](https://packager.turbowarp.org)

## A Note
This repo is not good. It was just because PhoneGap required content to be stored in a Github repo. I am simply keeping this as an archive to my first ever Github Project.
